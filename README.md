## About
From a fan's perspective, comebacks are one of the most exhilarating things in football. Who wouldn't love watching the team they support go from 0-2 down to win 3-2 with the last kick of the game? (The opponent maybe?). Even the players themselves get a rush from such a dramatic finish. The goal of this article is to determine which club in world football deserves the title of “Comeback Kings” and what statistics aid in this cause. Every club wants it, but surely only a few deserve the title.

We first determine the top clubs based on the total number of league wins from the 1994-05 season till date. We highlight a few interesting stories in their growth throughout the years. We then discover clubs with the most number of comebacks, combined with most number of wins and highest average margin of comeback. This answers the question of which clubs deserve the title "Comeback Kings".

We then analyze a few possible statistics to try and establish why these clubs achieve more comebacks.
